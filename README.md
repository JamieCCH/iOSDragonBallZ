Assignment 2 - Fighter Game W/ Dialog Text
Due: March 21, 2019
Weight: 12.5%
In this assignment you are asked to build a iOS game using SpriteKit. In this assignment you are to build a 2D fighter, similar to Street Fighter or my personal favourite, Dragonball Z. Look at this game I made in Java a while back for inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYkTSUImr5A

The game will have two screens:
1) UI Dialog Screen - Between 2 Characters (2.5%)
The UI dialog should begin your game, this is where the two characters fighting will go head to head and talk amongst each other before the fight begins. This should be created using labels, similar to the image above. Tapping the screen should advance the dialog line by line. Once the dialog has finished, your fight will begin! You will be graded on how well this dialog screen sets the mood of the fight. There needs to be at least three things said for each character.

Things to consider:
- What kind of background music or background image would make sense to have in this screen? Think about what kind of emotion you are trying to invoke from the player.
- How well do you indicate which character is talking? Think about using a visual aspect to display this, (i.e. making the character that is not talking more transparent, etc)

2) Game Screen - Fighting Scene
This is the fight scene between the two characters. Be sure to follow the checklist to receive full marks on the assignment:
Controls (2.5%) - On Screen Buttons
You will control movement of your character using on-screen arrow buttons, and perform different attacks by pressing buttons. It is completely up to you as to which attacks/blocks or moves each button will do. Your controls should be fluid and allow the player to move smoothly. You should have separate buttons to attack and move.

Health Bar (1.25%) - Character Health
A health bar will be placed at the top of the screen to show how much life the fighter has left. Once the health goes down to zero, the game will end. The A.I. should have itâ€™s own health bar as well.

Game Over Overlay (1.25%) - Display who won
Once the game is over, display who has won. The player should have the option to replay the game if they want to.

Timer (1.25%) - 3 minutes
A timer of three minutes for each game will be given. Once time has run out, the game will end. Whichever character has the most health after time has ended will win the game. 

Sound (1.25%) - Music & Sound Effects
Sound should be played when either player are hit or take damage. Be sure to add background music to the game as well.

AI (5%) - Simple A.I.
I do not expect your AI in this game to be super advanced, but it should be somewhat challenging for a player to win. Allow the A.I. to move to your player and perform either a block or an attack. Try your best to make this as realistic as possible - make the A.I. evade or block more when low on health, attack more when winning, use different attacks, melee and weapons/power blasts etc.

Bonus (2.5%)
Add a character selection screen that will allow me to select different characters to play with and fight against. You will receive full marks on this if I am able to choose different characters to play with, and also to play against. These characters must have their own custom dialog screen with at least three things said to each other as well.

Have fun!
